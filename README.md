# Name of Project
Multi Office Summarizer

# Tagline
An abstractive summarizer for office needs

# The problem it solves
It is used to summarise meetings by converting speech to text. The text file is then sent to the summariser to generate a summary. We have also built an optical charcter recognition system so that we can extract text data from pdf and convert it to a txt file and this txt file will also be fed to the summarizer. 

# Challenges we ran into
Running  the Tesseract and other related libraies we ran into dependency issues and finally we overcame it by using Linux and was not working with Windows.  
# Technologies we used
Python , HTML5 , CSS3 , Tensorflow , NLTK , PIL , Pillow , Pandas , Numpy , Tesseract
